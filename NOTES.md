# calendly

## Notes

By running the app, it should meet all the requirements as expected. Below are some notes to take note of

1. No 3rd-party tools installed as instructed
2. The app is made under an ember controller than a public-facing client JS so that the app is coded more elegantly. The calendar is written under a prototype-based implementation for better cohesion. I have added some optional parameters for the `calendar()` declaration so the calendar can be somewhat customized
3. Just for fun, I added a language option. English and Tagalog to name them. It can be modified by adding the `language: 'en'` parameter
